Propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation have always been part of political warfare. Social media and other new platforms have given it a new life and reach through which the fake news phenomenon can reach everywhere. We used this fact to propose a software that takes input in the form of a trend that the user wants to analyse. It helps the user to know about the authenticity of the trend and it also enables the user to take action if the misinformation is being spread. Our project is focused on developing software to help identify disinformation, misinformation and fake news. It will also take steps to counter that misinformation .
