# SocialMediaInvestigator

## Description

Propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation have always been used for political gains. Social
media and other new platforms have given it a new life and reach, through which fake news
phenomena can reach everywhere. We used this fact to propose a software that takes input in the form
of a trend that the user wants to analyse. It helps the user to know about the authenticity of the trend
and it also enables the user to take action if the misinformation is being spread.

SocialMediaInvestigator is a software that will identify the false information on
social media platforms by analysing the trends. Information will be analysed, in-depth
reports will be generated and steps will be taken to counter the misinformation.
